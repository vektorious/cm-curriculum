The Critical Making Curriculum teaches you best practices in critical making -- a way of working where:

* **_everyone_ is invited to collaborate on something amazing,**
* **and any new product or knowledge is shared widely and freely.**

This is for anyone starting up or leading an open hardware project-- project leads, collaborators, or small groups of co-leaders responsible for project success and growth.
